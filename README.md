# Titan
A starter theme for WordPress sites

# How I get setup?
This repository contains an entire WordPress installation. To get started, clone this repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. 

The theme directory (`wp-content/themes/titan`) contains an import file in `blocks/import` for the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. It contains the basic setup for a repeater block that can be used on pages, as well as the first block, which is a simple text box.

When you're done locally, simply upload the main directory to a server.
